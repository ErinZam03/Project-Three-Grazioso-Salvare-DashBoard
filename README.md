Grazioso Salvare Dashboard - README 
Summary of Artifact Submission
For this course, I am submitting the final dashboard code and the README file from Project Two to my GitHub repository. These artifacts demonstrate my ability to connect a user interface to a backend database using CRUD functionality. The dashboard was designed to meet Grazioso Salvare's requirements for managing animal rescue operations, showcasing my skills in creating a functional, user-centered solution.

Reflection on the Project
Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Programs
To ensure my programs are maintainable, I focused on clear and consistent coding practices, including meaningful variable names, modular functions, and in-line comments. For example, the CRUD Python module developed in Project One allowed me to separate database operations from the dashboard's user interface logic. This modular approach made the code more readable and easier to debug or extend. The CRUD module is highly reusable and could be adapted for future projects requiring database interactions, such as inventory management or customer record systems.

Approach to Problem-Solving
When tackling the requirements for Grazioso Salvare, I broke the problem into smaller, manageable tasks. For the database, I ensured the schema was optimized for the types of queries needed by the dashboard widgets, such as filtering animals by breed or vaccination status. This approach was more client-focused than previous assignments, as it required balancing technical feasibility with user needs. In the future, I would continue to use incremental development and early prototyping to validate requirements before diving into implementation.

The Role of Computer Scientists
Computer scientists create solutions that solve real-world problems efficiently and effectively. My work on this project enabled Grazioso Salvare to manage their animal rescue operations more effectively by automating data management and making information easily accessible through an intuitive dashboard. This type of work matters because it improves decision-making, saves time, and ultimately supports the organization's mission. By bridging the gap between technology and user needs, computer scientists play a critical role in enabling organizations to achieve their goals.
